A jack of all trades. Stu left his job as a lawyer at a Bay Street law firm in 2015 to follow his passion for design. His undergrad degree in Computing forms the backbone of his programming skills, but that's just the start of it. Equally adept in print design, web development and back-end coding, he has the tools to meet your design needs.
